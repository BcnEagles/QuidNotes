# Push

## What is the Push or Defensive Pressure?

Whenever the defending team loses all their bludgers it’s tradition to shout “No Bludgers!” so that chasers chargo to hoops to score as quickly as possible. Analogously when the offense loses all their beaters we will shout “Push!” and pressure the offense. The objective is to force the offense to use their reset, or force a pass that we can intercept, or beat the quaffle carrier. The main difference between “Push” and “No bludgers” - aside from the first being done in defense, while the other in offense - is that a good “Push” requires great coordination between chasers and beaters.

## When to do a Push

Generally the situation to do a Push will emerge when the attacking beaters try to beat the defending beaters and miss. In this situation the bludgers tend to roll far away, giving you the chance to recover bludger control (in case you didn’t have it) and freely pressure the attack for some seconds.

It’s also possible to force a Push with a very aggressive defense. The typical case would be a defense with bludger control where one of the beaters beats the opposing beater before they have the chance to do anything. Then they can take the bludger the opposing beater has left and start the Push - of course there are more ways to force a Push, but the main point is that if you win the duel you can do a Push.

## How to do a Push

1. The defending beater should shout “Push”. It can also be shouted by other players or the bench, but generally it should be done by the beaters.
2. One (and only one) of the beaters must go directly towards the quaffle carrier. All defending chasers should change their defense so that NO ATTACKING CHASER CAN RECEIVE A PASS - the goalkeeper should decide whether to leave the hoops. The second defending beater should stay behind to cover all passes and save any unexpected situation - especially the most dangerous situation: a pass to the Troll. 
3. The defending beater should force a pass by faking a throw or beating the quaffle carrier. BEWARE: if the quaffle carrier does a suicide pass that is not intercepted the attack may still surpass the Push and end up scoring.
4. If you have successfully forced the quaffle turnover it will be generally the case that the now defending team still has no bludgers, so your chasers should charge in a “No bludgers!” situation. 

## How to react to a Push

Only chasers can react to a Push (by definition). Thus they have to play very open and defensively, not doubting to use the reset (if that’s still an option). The objective is to wait for your beaters to recover bludger and come help you. A different option - much more risky - is to exploit any error in the enemy’s Push to score; this option won’t always be possible, and comes at the risk of losing the quaffle with no bludgers to defend our hoops.

The best answer to a Push is passing to the troll. However this will only be possible if the defending team leaves the troll undefended (by either chasers or beaters). This will generally be the case when the goalkeeper has not left the hoops and/or both defending beaters have advanced to force a pass from the quaffle carrier.

Passing the quaffle back to your own hoops: This is the most stable play, but it requires both having the reset available and that one chaser has run back to hoops. This should be done by the support, who, at the mere sight of a Push, should start running back as soon as possible.

Just run back to your side of the field: This play, which requires the use of the reset, is the standard reaction to a push. It doesn’t open as much space - since you can only cross one line by running, whereas you can cross both lines by passing - as the previous option, but it’s easier to do.

Suicide pass: Generally a very hard option, since every chaser should be defended, and the beater could just fake a throw and then beat the receiver. But it doesn’t need a reset so sometimes it will be one of the few options available.
