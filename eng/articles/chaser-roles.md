# Chaser Roles

## Defense

Observation: the category “chaser” will include the keeper

This is the translated document, but in the team we will use the spanish/catalan names. Thus the original names will be written in parenthesis.

### Roles
- **Point Guard Defender or Point** (Punta) 

  They defend the quaffle carrier. Two chasers may be defending the quaffle carrier, which we will call double point.

- **Wing** (Lateral) 

  They either defend an opposing wing, or defend the whole zone formed by the strong side - usually the left side, seen from the defense point of view. Its objective is to force the attack to the weak side.

- **Troll Defender or Troll** (Troll) 

  Only to be used when the enemy uses trolls and want to prevent the easy pass and goal. They defend behind the hoops.

- **Goalkeeper** (Portero)

  They defend the hoops from longshots. In case the quaffle carrier charges to the hoops the goalkeeper should leave the hoops to tackle them (just like a soccer goalkeeper, but with tackling). There can be more than one goalkeeper, in which case they have to coordinate, so that when one of them leaves the hoops to tackle the other moves to cover the space left open.

### Overall structure:
    
Chaser defenses can (should) be a mix of man-to-man defense and zone defense, since there are 4 defending chasers and 5 objectives to defend (4 chasers + hoops). Observations:

- The point guard defender always defends man-to-man, and the goalkeeper always defends a zone.
- The wing may defend a single person or they may defend the whole side, depending on the situation.
- The troll usually will be defended man-to-man, unless there are more trolls than troll defenders. (0 trolls ~ 0 troll defenders, 1 troll ~ 1 troll defender, 2 trolls ~ 1 troll defender, as a rule of thumb)

#### Examples:

- **Full man-to-man defense** 

  Extreme case where the hoops are left undefended and every chaser defends an opposing chaser.

- **Zone defense** 

  3 goalkeepers and a point defender. When the point defender is beat one of the goalkeepers must leave the hoops and substitute them, while the point defender goes back to hoops and completes the zone defense.

- **Almost full man-to-man defense** 

  A variation where one of the chasers plays as a goalkeeper, but the troll is left as a responsibility of the goalkeeper - thus having the goalkeeper defending both the hoops and the troll. It doesn’t sound very good but if you have bludger control you can use one of the beaters to threat the troll (or even cherry pick them)

- **False Keeper** 
  
  One goalkeeper and the rest of chasers make a T shape by placing themselves in the keeper zone line - while usually having the keeper as a point defender. This defense - while being very closed and weak to good throwers - makes that your point defender is immune to beaters, so having a good tackler will make it almost impossible for the enemy to penetrate the area.

## Offense

### Roles

1- **Point Guard or Playmaker** (Base)

  brings up the quaffle or organizes the offense. Requires good passing and throwing. Should analyze the game and react accordingly.

2- **Support** (Escolta)

  accompanies the playmaker. Should be able to support them (making a pick, offering a desperate passing option, running to take their hand when they are tackled, running back to hoops when receiving a Push), while also being able to cut and receive a pass, or even able to substitute the playmaker in case they are beat. 

3- **Wing** (Alero) 

  situated in the side of the field, should be able to receive a long pass and penetrate, see when to cut, or even go back to support the quaffle carrier if they need help.

4- **Troll** (Troll) 

  situated behind the hoops, should always be looking at the quaffle carrier ready to receive a pass, or be able to catch any missed throw. They will also be passed when the situation requires an inversion of the game (maybe the defending beaters have gone too far from the hoops). The troll should be a good receiver and be able to penetrate by themselves.

5- **Gnome** (Gnomo) 

  situated in a hoop (generally the left small one, but not necessarily) ready to receive and score. Acts as a kind of 4th hoop, but can also pick the goalkeeper. Can play full time as a gnome, but also a wing or a troll can change positions during a penetration and go stand the opposing hoop from where the quaffle carrier is penetrating, thus offering one extra option.
